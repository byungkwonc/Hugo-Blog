## What is Jamstack?

>Jamstack is an architectural approach that decouples the web experience layer from data and business logic, improving flexibility, scalability, performance, and maintainability.
>
>Jamstack removes the need for business logic to dictate the web experience.
>
>It enables a composable architecture for the web where custom logic and 3rd party services are consumed through APIs.
